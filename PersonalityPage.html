            <ul>
                <li> Playing Football</li>

            <h3>
                Football and Cricket
            </h3>
            <p>
                In my early adolcent years I played both footbal and cricket, these sport were used as a means 
                to escape the world around me. I was one of those things that I enjoyed wholey as a child.
                The advantage of these sports thought me that with the right team you can go very far in life but it also 
                highlights the importance of the contribution of every member of that team in order to be successful 
            </p>
           </div>
           <div>
            <h3>
                Reading
            </h3>
            <p>
                The habit of ready came about only a few years ago, around 2022 to be exact. During some self reflection I found myself reading
                multiple books that help me reshaped who I am today.

                just to name a few 
                 <ul>
                    <li> 48 Laws of Pwer by Robert Greene</li>
                    <li> Relationship Goals by Micheal Todd</li>
                    <li> The Art of Thinkking by Steven Schuster</li>
                 </ul>
            </p>
           </div>
           <div>
            <h3>
                Device Repair and dismantling
            </h3>
            <p>
                This is one of the most interesting hobbies I have. It Stated by replacing the screen of my Iphone 5s, yeah i know that's a pretty old phone. This 
                then led to me replacing the screen for my Iphone 8 and then cleaning the CPU fans of my Macbook pro as wall as changing the thermal paste.
                This Gave me the opportunity to be able to identify different components on a motherboards.
            </p>
           </div>  
           
           <div>
            <h3>
                What would be my Favorite motto and who is my hero?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Unlike others I do not have anythings that was said by anyone but instead created my own motto based on my morals and believes
                and this motto is "Wake up "Determine" got to sleep "SATISFIED"". With this motto I vow to never sleep unless I am satisfied with the work I have done 
                and or put in enough effort that I can be proud of.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now unto the fun part, This may be childish on my end but my father is me hero, I wastched my father work endlessly to 
                ensure that food is on the table and a roof is over me and my family's head. I know many days he is tired but still people-guest_people_search-cardeven when he was sick. So how can I not say he is my hero?

            <h3>
                My Traits
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am not sure are my good traits. I tend to live life one day at a time and this seems to be strange for some.
                However, I would say a few things that may stand out is my ability to still do the things that I am afraid of, Some may say that I am able to be calm under pressure 
                or in any situations which I find to be good as it allows me to navigate any given situation in the most effective manner.

           <div>
            <h3>
                Emotions
            </h3>
            <p>
                I have never been one to be controlled by my emotions, I see emotions as a element that helps one to make a moral decision
                but in some cases blinds you in make a logical choice. I have been called nonchalant even in my school life.
            </p>
            <div>
                My traits and the control I have over my emotions allows me to stay focus in school and not become overwhelmed where I 
                would give up or doubt myself. I try to identify how I feel in any situation and ask if it really warrants any action and 9 out of 10 time if 
                I did react I would be an emotional reaction. This is reflected in my school life as I continually 
                weight the cost of procrastination and getting the work done. "Today's procrastination is tomorrow's cost"

                PERSONALITY TEST
            </h3>
            <br>

            For the interest of knowing ones own personality, I habe taken the Similarmind online personality test.
            this text should that I am a lot more easy going than what I have originally thought and also 
            that I care very little for those materialistic things. However, there are areas that i new before hand would have range that 
            the score bracket.

                Self Reflection
            </h3>

            <p>
                I have many traits and many flaws all of which has shaped me into the person I am today. Many would say that it is good 
                and some will disagree ( everyone has the right to their own believes and opinios).
                However, I believe the person I am today allows me to be a delligent student and not a person 
                of procrastination. I get the work done no matter how i feel, " Why leave it for tomorrow when you can 
                do it today and rest tomorrow".
